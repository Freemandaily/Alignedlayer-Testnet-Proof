# Alignedlayer-Testnet-Proof
Aligned works with EigenLayer to leverage ethereum consensus mechanism for ZK proof verification. Working outside the EVM, this allows for cheap verification of any proving system. This enables the usage of cutting edge algorithms, that may use new techniques to prove even faster.
